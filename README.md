Welcome to the video_diary wiki! Based on this article https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html I have made app for demonstrate how to use MVP pattern with RX JAVA+Dagger2 and domain driven model. Please read this article above for understand more. In shame below we divide our app for 3 layer- Presenter,Domain and Data layer. In presentation layer we show information to user.(In this layer we avoid any heavy work. Just present user information). Domain layer. It's a simple pure java objects for transform data from presenter to data layer. In data layer we handle all handle process(in our case working with db).

All this layers communicate through interface for being max independent for other. For handle heavy process in data layer we use RXJava
